[Modao (墨刀)](https://modao.cc/)   



[Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/)


A quick walkthrough of Marvel:

- downloading Marvel onto your phone to run prototype *
- importing from Sketch with auto-updates
- adding transitions to different screens
- adding animations to those transitions
- if they can't download the prototype, another hack is to open it in the browser on your phone and save the link as a bookmark to your homescreen
